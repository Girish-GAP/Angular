 - Node.js   -> js indicates that its runtime environment for run javascript

 1) Javascript  (Pure open source)
 2) Typescript  (Strict syntactical optional superset by microsoft)
    - for missing features of js
    - .net 8 peoples comes to gether and developed typescript
    - typescript = js + datatypes
    - add supports of 
    
  3) Angular is own by Google.
     - Angular-js written by js
     - Angular written by ts

  - Every typescript program transpilation to js.
  - compilation mens go step down to near machine.
  - transpilation means change in same level only language change.

  // Toolchain of typescript
  - typescript -> javascript -> node-js(node js is a engine which run javascript)
  - typescript is a wrapper on javascript.

  *

  - v8 is a google chrome engine which run the js code.
  - ryan dial remove v8 engine from google and make it as a package. 
  
  - interpreter and compiler differance

  - compiler check line by line while running. (js code stop at run time)
  - interpreter check all first then run. (typescript)
  - if possible by v8 then its not going to microprocess if not possible then it will going to microprocessor 


  - EVERY JAVASCRIPT PROGRAM CAN CONSIDERD AS TYPESCRIPT PROGRAM. (Change extension only)
  - EVERY TYPESCRIPT PROGRAM CAN CONVERTED TO JS PROGRAM.



---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TYPESCRIPT NOTES :

- we have to install typescript : npm install -g typescript
- check (tsc --version)

- HOW TO RUN TS CODE : 
  1) tcs Demo.ts  (It will create js file)
  2) node Demo.js  

- Print : console.lon("");

- variable creation : var keyword
 - var str = "Gay ganesh"; 



// PROJECT CREATION

- its not using internet its using system call by CREATE.

 1) ng new project_name
 2) ask questions (Yes)
 3) packages installed successfully

 // it will create new folder 

4) ng serve  
  - ng : angular
  - serve : server

  - Angular start the server and open project 
  - it will gives the default port number 4200

5) paste the address on browser and you can see the project

    1) Clint side
        1. Fronted : html
        2. Backed : JS


    2) Server side

    - Angular js : by google only support javascript. (No longer supported)
    - Angular : by using typescript
    
    - typescript is a strict syntactical langauge.
    - NODE JS is a environment for run JS based on v8.

    - Dynamically typed and Statically typed.
    - Dynamically typed are Python, Javascript.
    - Statically typed Typescript (Optionally).



    // Datatypes :

    // Difference between undefined and null
    - undefined : memory is there but not defined which type of data we are going to store.
    - null : Memory is allocated and data type id known just not given value.

    // array - tupple

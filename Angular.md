# Environment for Angular :

## Node JS : 

Node or Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment 
that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.
<br><br>
Node. Js is a server-side platform built on Google Chrome Javascript Engine.
<br>
[ Node. js is not a programming language. Rather, it's a runtime environment that's used to run JavaScript outside the browser.]
<br><br>

To Check Node installed or not use command : 
<br>node or node --version
<br><br>
### To Install Node.js :

## npm  :

npm (Node Package Manager) is the package manager for the Node JavaScript platform. <br>
It puts modules in place so that node can find them, and manages dependency conflicts intelligently. 
<br>
It is extremely configurable to support a wide variety of use cases. Most commonly, it is used to publish, discover, install, and develop node programs.
<br>

npm is just like the personal assistant who give us what we want from big storage room and helps to maintain dependencies.
<br><br>

npm is automatically installed when we install node.
<br> To check installation use npm --version

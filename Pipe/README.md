# Pipes 
- The Angular pipes are used to Transform the Data. 
- Pipes takes data as input and formats or transform the data to display in the template.
- We use them to change the appearance of the data before presenting it to the user. 
- For Example, the Date pipe formats the date according to locale rules. 
- We can pass arguments to pipe and chain pipes. 
- The Angular also allows us to create the Custom Pipe.
